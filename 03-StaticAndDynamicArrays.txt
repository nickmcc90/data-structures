A static array is a fixed length container containing n elements,
indexable from the range [0, n-1];

Uses are:
Temporarily storing objects.
Lookup tables, things that are in order.
Able to return multiple values from a function.
Used in dynamic programming to cache answers to subproblems.

Accessing take O(1) time, and searching through it takes O(n) time. It doesn't
make sense to insert, append, or delete something from a static array. In dynamic arrays,
inserting and deleting takes O(n) time.

Dynamic arrays can grow and shrink in size.
